I am Sonya Ling.  A sharp-minded Staff Software Engineer with over 15-year experiences and a tenacious and proven-record tech lead of building data pipelines and high-volume distributed system end-to-end. I am a very kind, warm and passionate individual and am willing to walk extra miles to helping/ mentoring co-workers and ensure the quality of my work.

I am a lifetime learner and active in Cousera online and LinkedIn Learning etc. I was honored to be Community TA of ‘Functional Programming Principles in Scala’ Coursera course.  Teaching people how to solve tough problems is more challenging than solving tough problems myself.  I enjoyed that experience.  I recently learned 
'Generative AI with Large Language Models' provided by Amazon Web Services & DeepLearning.AI and am taking Agentic AI course in https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course.  Hopefully that can help me job searching.

Outside of my work, I am enjoying travelling, hiking and to be with my families and friends.  My hobbies are quick thinking logic games.  I am currently on 70-day streak of Zip and 65-day streak of Queens of LinkedIn Games.  Also I finished 5 months of Daily Challenge of expert level of Sudo App this year.
