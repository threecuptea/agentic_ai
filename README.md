# agentic_ai

This is a repo that I showcase what I learned from [AI Engineer Agentic Track: The Complete Agent & MCP Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/) and Agentic AI applications deployed in [HuggingFace](https://HuggingFace.co) in this course

* [Career Conversation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/threecuptea/career_conversation_sonya): Consider it as an interactive Sonya's resume/ profile. It's a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) ChatBatbot application that can engage coversations with users and pass questions to OpenAI GPT's LLM model that would reply given my Linked profile and summary as the context.  It also interfaces with [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) text notification. I registered two customized Agent tool functions 'record_user_details' and 'record_unknown_question' with OpenAI and give instruction to encourage users to leave email address and call tool 'record_user_details' with the email given and call 'record_unknown_question' to record questions if the model is unable to answer.  Both tool functions will notify me via text message.  The design and prompts are well thought out and is very applicable.
