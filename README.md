# agentic_ai

This is a repo that I showcase what I learned from [AI Engineer Agentic Track: The Complete Agent & MCP Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/) and Agentic AI applications deployed in [HuggingFace](https://HuggingFace.co) in this course

* [Career Conversation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/threecuptea/career_conversation_sonya): Consider it as an interactive Sonya's resume/ profile. It's a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) ChatBatbot application that can engage coversations with users and pass questions to OpenAI GPT's LLM model that would reply given my Linked profile and summary as the context.  It also interfaces with [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) text notification. I registered two customized Agent tool functions 'record_user_details' and 'record_unknown_question' with OpenAI and give instruction to encourage users to leave email address and call tool 'record_user_details' with the email given and call 'record_unknown_question' to record questions if the model is unable to answer.  Both tool functions will notify me via text message.  The design and prompts are well thought out and is very applicable.
* [Deep Research v2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/threecuptea/deep_research2): It's an improved version of [Deep Research with OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/ed-donner/agents/tree/main/2_openai/deep_research) - A simple multi-agent app. Research manager coordinates with plan_agent: coming up with 3 search terms for the query given; search_agent: searching with [OpenAI WebSearch Tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search); write_agent: cominng up the outline and writing report in markdown format based upon the requirement; email_agent: coming up the subject and converting the report to HTML format to send to the hard-coded designated email. I added features to send a copy to the email given upon request as well as verify the email using an input guardrail.  I have to pass multiple inputs to the email agent. The process of searching for the answer (ends up passing an email prompt) reminds me that LLM is behind the scenes.
  Lesson learned and things to improve: LLM is non-deterministic and need to learn context engineering so that the result can be more predictable.  Add evaluator agenet(s) in important steps to ensure the quality.  Of course, API rate limit, so that those apps won't break my budget!!
